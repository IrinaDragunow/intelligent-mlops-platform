- **Quality Assurance:** Black, Flake8, Security Scanning

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Local Development
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd intelligent-mlops-platform

# Create conda environment
conda create -n mlops-platform python=3.11 -y
conda activate mlops-platform

# Install dependencies
conda install -c conda-forge streamlit pandas numpy requests -y

# Start platform
streamlit run app.py
```

### Docker Deployment
```bash
# Build image
docker build -t intelligent-mlops .

# Run container
docker run -p 8501:8501 intelligent-mlops
```

## 📊 Pipeline Stages

1. **🧪 Quality Assurance:** Code Quality, Security Checks, Dependency Validation
2. **🐳 Container Build:** Docker Image Build & Push to Registry
3. **🚀 Staging Deployment:** Automated Staging Environment Deployment
4. **🌟 Production Deployment:** Enterprise Production Deployment (with approval)
5. **📢 Status Report:** Comprehensive Pipeline Status Summary

## 📈 Monitoring & Health

- Health Check Endpoint: `/_stcore/health`
- Container Health Checks every 30 seconds
- Automatic restart on failure
- Real-time system metrics

## 🔧 Development Workflow

### Code Quality
```bash
# Formatting
black .

# Linting  
flake8 .

# Type checking
mypy .
```

### Testing
```bash
# Unit tests
pytest tests/

# Integration tests
pytest tests/integration/
```

## 🌐 Automated Deployment

The platform deploys automatically when code is pushed to `main`:

1. Quality Assurance runs automatically
2. Docker Image is built and secured
3. Staging Deployment with integration tests
4. Production Deployment (with manual approval)

## 📝 Environment Configuration

For local development, create `.env` file:
```
ENVIRONMENT=development
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
PLATFORM_MODE=local
```

## 🤝 Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/intelligent-enhancement`)
3. Commit changes (`git commit -m 'Add intelligent feature'`)
4. Push branch (`git push origin feature/intelligent-enhancement`)
5. Open Pull Request
